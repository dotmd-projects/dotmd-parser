Dependency graph parser for `.md` skill files — built for AI agent prompt engineering with [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) and similar tools.

## Why dotmd-parser?

As AI agent projects grow, `SKILL.md` files start referencing each other via `@include` and `@delegate` directives. Without tooling, you're left manually tracing dependencies to answer basic questions:

- *"Which files break if I edit `shared/role.md`?"*
- *"Is there a circular reference hiding in my skill tree?"*
- *"What `{{variables}}` are still unresolved after expansion?"*

**dotmd-parser** solves this by parsing your `.md` files into a dependency graph — automatically detecting directives, runtime references, and template placeholders. One function call gives you the full picture.

## Comparison

| Capability | Manual / grep | dotmd-parser |
|---|---|---|
| Find `@include` / `@delegate` references | `grep -r "@include"` — flat list, no context | Structured graph with node types and edge metadata |
| Detect circular references | Hope you notice before the agent loops | Automatic detection with full cycle path in warnings |
| Reverse dependency ("what breaks?") | Manually trace every file | `dependents_of(graph, "shared/role.md")` — one call |
| Expand `@include` to final text | Copy-paste by hand | `resolve("SKILL.md", variables={...})` — recursive expansion |
| Find unresolved `{{variables}}` | `grep "{{" *.md` — noisy, no dedup | Deduplicated list per node and after expansion |
| Missing file detection | Runtime failure | Warnings at parse time with exact paths |

## Installation

```bash
pip install dotmd-parser
```

## Quick Start

```python
from dotmd_parser import build_graph, resolve, dependents_of, summary
```

### build_graph — Build a dependency graph

```python
graph = build_graph("./my-skill/")
# or from a specific file
graph = build_graph("./my-skill/SKILL.md")
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {"id": "/abs/path/to/SKILL.md", "type": "skill", "missing": false, "placeholders": []}
  ],
  "edges": [
    {"from": "...", "to": "...", "type": "include", "parallel": false}
  ],
  "warnings": []
}
```

### resolve — Expand @include directives

```python
result = resolve("./prompts/main.md", variables={"name": "Alice"})

print(result["content"])       # Fully expanded text
print(result["placeholders"])  # Unresolved {{variable}} names
print(result["warnings"])      # Circular refs, missing files, etc.
```

### dependents_of — Reverse dependency query

```python
# "If I change shared/role.md, what else breaks?"
affected = dependents_of(graph, "/abs/path/to/shared/role.md")
```

### summary — Human-readable overview

```python
print(summary(graph))
# Nodes: 5  (agent:1, shared:2, skill:1, reference:1)
# Edges: 4  (include:3, read-ref:1)
# Warnings: 0
```

## Supported Directives

| Directive | Description |
|---|---|
| `@include path/to/file.md` | Inline expansion — file content is inserted at this position |
| `@delegate path/to/agent.md` | Agent delegation — recorded in graph but not expanded |
| `@delegate path/to/agent.md --parallel` | Parallel delegation with `--parallel` flag |
| `` Read `path/to/file.md` `` | Runtime reference — not expanded, but tracked in the graph |

## CLI

```bash
# Installed as a command
dotmd-parser ./my-skill/

# Or via Python module
python -m dotmd_parser.parser ./my-skill/
```

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dotmd-projects/dotmd-parser.git
cd dotmd-parser
pip install -e .
pip install pytest
pytest tests/ -v
```
